Sdmap remaps the Steam Deck controller and provides a gamepad mode and a desktop mode without the need to launch Steam. You need a kernel with support for the controller (linux >=6.3).

~~~
SD controller -> Sdmap -> ungrab -> game
(input dev)            -> grab -> keyboard+trackpad (virtual dev) -> libinput -> wayland/xorg
~~~

**Please note that since [linux 6.8](https://github.com/torvalds/linux/commit/cd438e57dd05b077f4e87c1567beafb2377b6d6b) the controller starts in lizard mode. Long press the start button to switch to gamepad mode to be able to use sdmap.**

## Install

A [PKGBUILD](arch/) is provided to [build and install](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Arch_User_Repository#Installing_and_upgrading_packages) Sdmap on Arch Linux. Once installed, the `sdmap.service` systemd service can be enabled and started (`systemctl enable --now sdmap.service`). The daemon can also be tested outside the service by running `sdmap-daemon`.

You might also want to use sdmap during early userspace to be able to type your encryption passphrase without an external keyboard. To do so, add the `sdmap` hook before `encrypt` in the `HOOKS` array of `/etc/mkinitcpio.conf`.

## Virtual Keyboard Sticker

A [sticker](https://i.imgur.com/DHEOmFD.png) can be generated and [printed](https://i.imgur.com/a7Mk0GY.jpg) for the virtual keyboard on the left trackpad. It's a simple solution that didn't require me to develop a GUI. I printed the sticker on photo paper and glued it on the trackpad. The controller vibrates to provide feedback when the user moves their finger between cells.

## GUI

I initially didn't develop a GUI and only relied on the sticker described above. Unfortunately I found it frustrating, often mistyping a character from the row above or below the one I intended. The current iteration of `sdmap-gui` is a simple desktop notification sent each time the finger moves to a different cell on the left trackpad.
